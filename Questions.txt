Coding Questions : 

** Number Related **

1> Write a program to sum of n numbers

2> Write a progran for sum of all digits. => find rem then add into sum then divide it

3> Write a program to reverse the Number => find rem then add it into sum with sum*10 

4> Write a program to find GCD/HCM and LCM of n numbers => for any array gdc we can use 
	callback function like. a[]={12,6} then gcd=a[0] pass it gcd(gcd,a[i]) func
	if b==0 then return a else then return gcd(b,a%b)
5> Find the given number is armstrong not or print range of numbers.
	find sum of cube of digits then compare with original.

6> find the factorial of number with and without recursion
	recursion = n*fact(n-1).
	progran n=1 for loop   multiplu n=n*i


7> Print Prime factors of given number.
	=> for factors if n%i==0 then return i 
	   for prime from 2 to n/2		
		if(n%i==0)
			change flag

		if flag original then return n


8> Palindrom or not number.
	fin rev then compare with original.


9> find the number is perfect sqrt is not.
	find sqrt then compare with original.


10> Find the number is perfect or not. Logic:- find the factors of numbr :- 6=> 1,2,3
    if 1+2+3 === 6 then perfect.

11> Find the number is composite or not. Logic opposite of prime.

23> How do you check if two strings are a rotation of each other? (notice)
24> How do you check if a given string is a palindrome? (notice)
25> How do you find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters? (notice) Tough
26> Given string str, How do you find the longest palindromic substring in str? (notice)
27> how to remove the duplicate character from String? (notice)
28> How to find the maximum occurring character in given String? (notice)
29> How do you remove a given character from String? (notice)
